			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>My name is Theophelous Scantlebury. <br>I am a struggling father of three daughters and aspiring to get into the field of computer science. <br>My goal is not only to find a newfound career in Computer InformatIon Systems, but find myself given many opportunities within that field and those related. <br>I previously graduated from El Camino under a different degree, but regardless, I returned to find a career I can find pride in.</p>
		<section><h3>My Three Main Hobbies</h3>
 			<ul>
    			<li>Writing out stories that form in my head (when I am given the time).</li>
    			<li>Reading other stories or listening to podcasts.</li>
    			<li>Playing games with my family (that doesn't involve any bodily harm to me, lol).</li>
 			</ul>
		</section>
			<p>While I do frequent many websites due my need to expand my knowledge in computer science, one of my favorite websites is <a href="https://toyhou.se/">Toyhou.se</a> <br>as it gives me insight on the many artistic talents of those who have a more creative talent with pictures.</p>
